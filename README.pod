=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Apocalyptic - Let the apocalypse build your dist!

=head1 VERSION

  This document describes v0.004 of Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Apocalyptic - released October 24, 2014 as part of Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Apocalyptic.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin bundle attempts to automate as much as sanely possible the job of building your dist. It builds upon
L<Dist::Zilla> and utilizes numerous plugins to reduce the burden on the programmer.

	# In your dist.ini:
	name = My-Super-Cool-Dist
	[@Apocalyptic]

Don't forget the new global config.ini file added in L<Dist::Zilla> v4!

	apoc@blackhole:~$ cat .dzil/config.ini
	[%User]
	name  = Apocalypse
	email = APOCAL@cpan.org

	[%Rights]
	license_class    = Perl_5
	copyright_holder = Apocalypse

	[%PAUSE]
	username = APOCAL
	password = myawesomepassword

=head2 dist.ini

This is equivalent to setting this in your dist.ini:

	# Skipping the usual name/author/license/copyright stuff

	[SchwartzRatio]		; informs us of old distributions lingering on CPAN

	[ReportPhase / EXIT]	; reports the dzil build phases

=head1 Setting options

However, this plugin bundle does A LOT of things, so you would need to read the config carefully to see if it does
anything you don't want to do. You can override the options simply by removing the offending plugin from the bundle
by using the L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Filter> package. By doing that you are free to specify alternate plugins,
or the desired plugin configuration manually.

	# In your dist.ini:
	name			= My-Super-Cool-Dist
	author			= A. U. Thor
	license			= Perl_5
	copyright_holder	= A. U. Thor

	; we don't want to archive our releases
	; we want to push to gitorious instead
	[@Filter]
	bundle = @Apocalyptic
	remove = ArchiveRelease
	remove = Git::Push
	[Git::Push]
	push_to = gitorious

=head2 Newer method to manipulate this bundle

This PluginBundle now supports L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::ConfigSlicer>, so you can pass in options to the plugins used like this:

	[@Apocalyptic]
	Git::Push.push_to = gitorious

This PluginBundle also supports L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::PluginRemover>, so dropping a plugin is as easy as this:

	[@Apocalyptic]
	-remove = ArchiveRelease

=head1 Future Plans

=head2 use XDG's Twitter plugin

I want to tweet and be a web2.0 dude! :)

=head2 use GETTY's cool Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Run::AfterRelease

I want to use that to automatically install the generated tarball

	sudo cpanp i --force file:///home/apoc/mygit/perl-dist-zilla-pluginbundle-apocalyptic/Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Apocalyptic-0.001.tar.gz

However, how do I get the full tarball path?

=head2 Work with Task::* dists

From Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::FLORA

	; Not sure if it supports config_plugin = @Bundle like PodWeaver does...
	[TaskWeaver]	; weave our POD for a Task::* module ( enabled only if it's a Task-* dist )

	has is_task => (
	    is      => 'ro',
	    isa     => Bool,
	    lazy    => 1,
	    builder => '_build_is_task',
	);

	method _build_is_task {
	    return $self->dist =~ /^Task-/ ? 1 : 0;
	}

	...

	$self->is_task
        ? $self->add_plugins('TaskWeaver')
        : $self->add_plugins([ 'PodWeaver' => { config_plugin => '@FLORA' } ]);

=head2 I would like to start digging into the C<dzil new> command and see how to automate stuff in it.

=head3 Changes creation

create a Changes file with the boilerplate text in it

	Revision history for Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Apocalyptic

	{{$NEXT}}

		initial release

=head3 github integration

automatically create github repo + set description/homepage via L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UpdateGitHub> and L<App::GitHub::create> or L<App::GitHub>

=head3 gitorious integration

unfortunately there's no perl API for gitorious? L<http://www.mail-archive.com/gitorious@googlegroups.com/msg01016.html>

=head3 .gitignore creation

it should contain only one line - the damned dist build dir "/Foo-Dist-*"
also, it needs the "/.build/" line?

=head3 Eclipse files creation

create the .project/.includepath/.settings stuff

=head3 submit project to ohloh

we need more perl projects on ohloh! there's L<WWW::Ohloh::API>

=head2 DZP::PkgDist

Do we need the $DIST variable? What software uses it? I already provide that info in the POD of the file...
