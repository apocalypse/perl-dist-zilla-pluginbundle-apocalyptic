=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the bundle used by default (specifically by Pod::Weaver's
C<new_with_default_config> method).  It may change over time, but should remain
fairly conservative and straightforward.

It is nearly equivalent to the following:

  [@CorePrep]

  [Name]
  [Version]

  [Region  / prelude]

  [Generic / SYNOPSIS]
  [Generic / DESCRIPTION]
  [Generic / OVERVIEW]

  [Collect / ATTRIBUTES]
  command = attr

  [Collect / METHODS]
  command = method

  [Collect / FUNCTIONS]
  command = func

  [Leftovers]

  [Region  / postlude]

  [Authors]
  [Legal]

=head1 TODO

What I want to do is...

=head2 Add my usual SUPPORT section automatically

This only exists in the main module, not submodules

also, automatically add the =for pod_spelling FOO BAR BAZ stuff preceding it

=head2 Add DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY head1 section

( Where can I get this text? Software::License? )

Also, this exists only in the main module

=head2 SEE ALSO section

Automatically add a link from submodules to main module + whatever was specified if the section existed

=head2 Add "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" as sub-section of AUTHOR

So I can give the proper props :)
